# Capstone-project

## 1. Aims of the project
1.1 The aims of this project were to design and produce a game that is our own take on a retro game; if that were to be in the form of making a game that is similar to the retro game but the differences and our take of the game can be clearly pointed out or uses the base idea of the game such as the feel or gameplay and the rest of the game is our own. The sole goal at the end of the project is to produce a game that we have taken inspiration from a retro game. 

I will be making a rebooted version of the classic game Mario where instead of collecting things like mushrooms, and fire flowers there will be a upgrade system where you can upgrade certain aspects of the character, for example aspects like movement speed, damage and jump height and ect.
